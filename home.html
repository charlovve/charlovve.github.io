        <p>Something I soend a lot of my time doing is Photography Club. I am a part of Photography Club in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, I like using cameras and taking pictures. I also like taking videos of my good friends when we are having a lot of fun. I love my friends and spending time with my friends. </p>
        
        <p>A fun fact about me is when I was in Primary school I was outisde the Asian Civilisation Museum playing with sparklers and my mom decided to give a sparker to a kid who look like he wanted to play and he jabbed the sparkler into my butt and burnt a part of it. It hurt like hell. </p>
